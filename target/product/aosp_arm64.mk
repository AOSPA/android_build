# The system image of aosp_arm64-userdebug is a GSI for the devices with:
# - ARM 64 bits user space
# - 64 bits binder interface
# - system-as-root
# - VNDK enforcement
# - compatible property override enabled

# This is a build configuration for a full-featured build of the
# Open-Source part of the tree. It's geared toward a US-centric
# build quite specifically for the emulator, and might not be
# entirely appropriate to inherit from for on-device configurations.
