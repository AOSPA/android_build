message='usage: tapas [<App1> <App2> ...] [arm|x86|arm64|x86_64] [eng|userdebug|user] [devkeys]

tapas selects individual apps to be built by the Android build system. Unlike
"lunch", "tapas" does not request the building of images for a device.
Additionally, an app built with "tapas" will have its dex file inside its apk,
which should cause it to be suitable for installing on any api-compatible
device. In other words, "tapas" configures the build of unbundled apps.

The names <App1> <App2> ... should match LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME as defined in an
Android.mk

The usage of the other arguments matches that of the rest of the platform
build system and can be found by running `m help`'
