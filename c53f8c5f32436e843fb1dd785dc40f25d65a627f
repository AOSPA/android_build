      "message": "The fact is that our current recovery doesn\u0027t allow us to downgrade to the last build, every time I do a test build and it doesn\u0027t boot, I need to do format data, I only have a device and I use it as the main one, So doing format data in these cases is problematic. This commit works on Surya currently, I didn\u0027t have time to test it on spes which is AB, so ours I can say it will work on AB devices too.",
